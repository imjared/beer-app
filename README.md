========

This app was built (rather hastily) using [yeoman](http://www.yeoman.io). Yeoman is a node.js package that provides initial app scaffolding as well as a ton of nifty tools to make front end dev better.

To make edits to this repo, you should install Yeoman..

**Installing yeoman:**

1. Install [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) by following the directions at the bottom of [http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).

2. Install [nvm (node version manager)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). After nvm is installed and activated, follow the [usage](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#usage) instructions to upgrade node to the latest version. As of this writing, Node v0.8.1 will work with Yeoman. So, you'll want to run `$ nvm install 0.8.1`.

3. Visit [yeoman.io](http://www.yeoman.io) for Yeoman installation instructions.

4. Once Yeoman is installed, `cd` to your project directory and fire up Yeoman by running `$ yeoman server`. This will launch a local server. To kill the server, use `cmd + c`.

5. Project content lives in the /app directory.
